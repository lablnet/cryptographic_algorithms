# Cryptographic Algorithms.

My own implementation of the [Cryptographic Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_algorithm) in Python.

I have implemented the following algorithms:
- [x] [Substitution Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)
- [x] [Stream Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher)
- [x] [Affine Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher).
- [x] [Shift Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_cipher)
- [x] [DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DES_supplementary_material)
- [x] [3DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES)
- [x] [DESX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DES_X)
  

I am working on the following algorithms:

- [ ] [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
- [ ] [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA)

I am following these Courses to learn more about the algorithms:
1. [Cryptography 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto)
2. [introduction to cryptography by christof paar](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Cryptography-Textbook-Students-Practitioners/dp/3642446493)
