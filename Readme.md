# Cryptographic Algorithms.

My own implementation of the [Cryptographic Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_algorithm) in Python.

I have implemented the following algorithms:
- [x] [Substitution Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)
- [x] [Stream Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher)
- [x] [Affine Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher).
- [x] [Shift Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_cipher)
- [x] [DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DES_supplementary_material)
- [x] [3DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES)
- [x] [DESX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DES_X)
- [ ] [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
- [x] Block Cipher Modes
    - [x] ECB (Electronic Code Book)
    - [x] CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
    - [x] OFB (Output Feedback Mode)
    - [x] CTR (Counter Mode)
- [ ] Public Key Encryption.
    - [x] [RSA](./algorithms/public_key/RSA.py)
    - [x] [RSA-CRT](./algorithms/public_key/RSA_CRT.py)
    - [x] [Diffie-Hellman](./algorithms/public_key/diffie_hellman.py)

I am following these Courses to learn more about the algorithms:
